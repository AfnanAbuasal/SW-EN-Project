I implemented a simple version of the car rental website using django, if you have already downloaded django and has a python downloaded on your pc, all you have to do is to pull all the files in this pranch and 
then excute these commands:
py manage.py runserver : to launch the server and see the project.
py manage.py createsuperuser: --> Username: <any username>
Email address: <any email>
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.

this will make you be able to use admin site to add instances of the classes easily.
